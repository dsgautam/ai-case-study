## **Overview and origin**
### 1. **Company Name -** Nvidia

### 2. **Incoporation** 
The company was founded on April 5, 1993 in Sunnyvale, California, USA

### 3. **Founders**
The company was founded by Jensen Huang, Curtis Priem, and Chris Malachowsky. Jensen previously worked at LSI Logic and at AMD, Chris worked at Sun Microsystems, and Curtis had prior experiences at IBM and Sun Microsystems[^Wikipedia].


### 4. **Origin of Idea**
The trio of co-founders wanted to tackle the challenges posed by accelerated computing especially in the graphics-based processing, such as gaming, which was hitherto unsolved by the general-purpose copmputing solutions available at that time. The initial focus was to solve computational challenges posed by gaming software, a growing market.

### 5. **Company Funding**
The company was funded initially by a $40,000 investment put in by the founders. Subesequently, the company received, venture capital investments from Sequoia Capital and others. The company wnet public on January 22, 1999 at $12/share. Nvidia is traded under the symbol NVDA on NASDAQ stock exchange. The current stock price is listed at $464 as of December 6, 2023, with a 52 week high of $505.48

## **Business Activities**
For more than 30 years, Nvidia has been deeply involved in solving problems that no one could solve. With more than 4 million developers creating applications for accelerated computing, some 40,000 companies, according to their website, use Nvidia technologies in different ways to do amazing things from GPU (graphical processin Unit) for Computer Graphics to devloping Parallel Processing capabilities using CUDA architecture to applications in AI such as enabling Large Language Models, that has been the buzz of the town of late.

### 1. **Specific problems Addressed**
Nvidia initially set out to tackle the challenges posed by accelerated computing, especially in the field of graphics-based process. Later on with several successes under their belt, and through multiple rounds of innovation, they are now regarded as pioneers in the field of AI and are leading the charge in solving some of the most complex problems in the field of AI. Their work in AI and digital twins is transforming the world's largest industries and deeply impacting the society, in general[^Nvidia].

### 2. **Customers and Market size**

Nvidia's customers come from wide range of industries given their position in the AI Chip market and the software that goes with it in handling the complex algorithms to run AI processes. According to Nvidia's website, their technology is used by 40,000 companies across various industries. Nvidia technologu solutions are used in Datacenters, Gaming devices, Content Creation and rendering, Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals, Finance, Automatonomous Driving, Gene Sequencing, Industrial digitalization, Robotics, and Generative AI. 

AI chip market in 2022 reached $44 billion, expected to be $53 billion in 2023, and likely to grow to $120 Billion by 2027. According to numbers published in Statista, the overall AI technology market is currently estimated to be $100 Billion and expected to grow 20 times its current value to $2 Trillion by 2030. Nvidia commands 80% of the datacenter AI Chip Market share today, and is expected to continue its pole position, despite growing competition from many other companies, including AMD, Google, Microsoft, and other startups. The explosion of interest in generative AI since the release of ChatGPT's latest updates, and the growing interest in industry as well as in academia will further accelerate the growth in the consumption of AI technologies.


### 3. **Competitive Advantage vs Competition**
 Nvidia Chips that power th AI technologies are dominating the markets. They have been pioneers and leaders in enabling the AI technology thanks to their early start, while they continue to innovate and build products that are able to scale and supercharge the industries that depend on their products. With demand surging, and with AI chips selling for higher costs, the race is heating between the big tech players such as Tesla, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, AMD, and Intel, each wanting to claim a chunk of the market and create a competitive advantage by reducing their dependence on Nvidia. But the fact remains that Nvidia is way ahead currently in churning out products that enable AI solutions worldwide [^yahoo].


### 4. **Technology**
Nvidia is currently using a commbination of hardware and software technologies that are powering the latest craze in AI development and consumption. They have reinvented the computer graphics with real-time ray-tracing using Nvidia RTX products. They are playing foundational role in the building of the metaverse, the next genration of internet with their Omniverse Platform. Nvidia's semiconductor chips power the AI factories world over. Nvidia'a Hopper architecture, and their next generation of supercomputer chips such as DGX GH200 are promising to hyperscale the AI datacenters, capable of churning faster data processing workloads and enabling development of next-generation of models for AI languuage applications, recommender systems, and analytics engines[^Nvidia]. 


## **Landscape**
### 1. **Field**
The company is in semiconductory industry that is empowering the AI revolution. It also has software stack to go along with its Chips that enables accelerated computing for many industries.

### 2. **Trends**
Demand for AI technologies are going at a breakneck speed, more so after the head-turning success of the ChatGPT models. The use of data-driven analytics and self-serving tools is growing at a phenomenal speed, which is requiring large amounts of compute, storage, and processing power to efficiently process the vast tranches of data, draw inisghts, and provide recommendations in near real-time. This trend has grown tremendesouly over the last 5-10 years and will continue to accelerate in the future.

### 3. **Other Players in the field**
 Comapnies like Amazon, Tesla, Google, Microsoft, AMD, and Intel are other major players in the field. There are several new startups equally wanting to disrupt the market and be the game-changer in the AI revolution

## **Results**
### 1. **Business Impact**
Nvidia has seen huge growth in their market valuation. Their annual revenue and net income and financial metrics has maintained their upward trend and has witness signficant growth in recent years as the demand of their products and solutions have grown. From a 11 Billion revenue in 2020 and net income of 2.8 billion, it has more than doubled its revenue in 2023 and net income. Its current market cap in excess of 1 Trillion.

### 2. **Success Criteria**
The success of Nvidia is measured in how widely their products and solutions are in use in solving some of the biggest AI challenges and accelerated computing from AI to gaming to creative design to autonomous driving and robotics. However, they need to continue to innovate and continue to invest in R&D to stay ahead in the race.


### 3. **Company Performance**
In recent years, Nvidia's stock has performed signficantly better than their comptetiors. Thankss to their dominance in datacenter AI chips, Bit coin mining, and gaming software, their revenue and profitablity have soared dramatically.
 

## **Recommendations**
### 1. **Advice to the company**
Nvidia needs to be wary of the surging competition from large players and startup disruptors as the demand of their products go up and chips run in short supply, as witnessed during Covid period. They need to continue investing in R&D to address the growing demands from all directions.  They also need to be able to service the needs of induistries that traditionally did not look for AI solutions, but are now stepping into the arena. They also need to diversify to address the political risks by creating manufactoring facilities outside the low-cost economies such as China.


### 2. **Benefits of the Advice**
AI technologies are going to impact human lives and societies in ways unseen and unimagined before. By planning for various risks and by continuing to invest in the right areas, Nvidia has potential to become the largest most signficant company for a long time.


### 3. **Other Relevant Technologies**
Building solutions or developing technologies that improve human health, in general,  and keep the world free from deadly diseases, hunger, and natural disasters by anticipating the future needs and sustainable actions will be a great area to invest and grow into.
